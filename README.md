# Joda-Time: Enhanced Version with Jenkins CI/CD Integration

## Overview
This fork of **Joda-Time** extends the original library by integrating it with **Jenkins CI/CD pipelines** to automate testing, build validation, and deployment. The modifications enhance the maintainability and reliability of Joda-Time in continuous integration workflows.

## Features & Enhancements
- **Jenkins Integration**: Configured automated builds and test execution using Jenkins.
- **Improved Logging**: Enhanced logging mechanisms for better debugging in CI/CD environments.
- **Maven Support**: Optimized the `pom.xml` for seamless integration with Jenkins and dependency management.
- **Unit Testing**: Implemented additional **JUnit test cases** to validate time-based operations.
- **Error Handling Improvements**: Strengthened exception handling to improve robustness.

## Setup Instructions
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **JDK 17**
- **Maven**
- **Jenkins** (if running locally)

### Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/joda-time.git
cd joda-time
```

### Build and Test with Maven
```sh
mvn clean install
```

### Running Jenkins Pipeline
1. Configure **Jenkins** with a new pipeline project.
2. Use the following `Jenkinsfile` for pipeline execution:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                git 'https://github.com/yeezerdaw/joda-time.git'
            }
        }
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn clean compile'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }
    }
}
```
